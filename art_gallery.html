    <br>
    <p>Probably the most famous painting in the world is Leonardo da Vinci's La Gioconda, better known as Mona Lisa. This painting is a portrait of Madame Gherardini, personifying the ideal woman of the Renaissance. They tried to damage the painting more than once, and in 1911 it was also kidnapped, returning only 2 years later. Admiration for it truly knows no bounds: Napoleon Bonaparte even removed it from the museum and ordered to hang it in his own bedroom. The painting is officially declared priceless, which is not surprising, as this masterpiece is the best art of all time. The only existing price is its $ 3 billion insurance. Mona Lisa is currently kept in the Louvre, Paris.</p>

    <h2>2. The Birth of Venus by Sandro Botticelli (1486)</h2>

    <br>
    <p>Another of the most famous paintings is The Birth of Venus. Botticelli's painting illustrates the myth of the birth of Aphrodite. The beautiful goddess drifts to the shore in a sea shell, driven by the Zephyr's wind (West wind), and on the shore she is met by one of the Graces. The Birth of Venus is well preserved thanks to the fact that Botticelli applied a protective layer of egg yolk to the painting. This masterpiece is kept in Florence in the Uffizi Gallery.</p>

    <br>
    <p>Michelangelo's fresco The Creation of Adam, which adorns the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Palace, is the fourth of the nine famous art pieces of the central composition dedicated to scenes from the Book of Genesis. The fresco illustrates an episode of the first human being creation by God. In addition to depicting ideal human forms, the fresco is one of the first attempts in the history of art to depict the God himself.</p>
